# outline-toc.el

An Emacs extension that will render a "table of contents" for any buffer in outline-mode.

This TOC will show the sections in the document, highlighting the one that
you're editing in the master document. The whole idea is to give you context as
you're editing a large outline-mode document (e.g. a markdown file or something).

## Current status

Right now this doesn't do a whole lot. You can open up the TOC and it'll stay
roughly synchronized with your master doc. It doesn't do highlighting or
anything like that yet.
