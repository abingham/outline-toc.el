;;; Commentary:

;; This provides a sidebar buffer which shows a "table of contents" for an
;; associated outline-mode buffer. Basically, this shows you the sections of the
;; outline-mode buffer, but not the bodies. This is to help you remember where
;; you are in a large document.

;; Simply use M-x outline-toc-mode to toggle activation of the outline-toc.
;; Use 'M-x customize-group RET outline-toc RET' to adapt outline-toc to your
;; needs.

;; Much of this was originally adapated from David Engster's excellent
;; minimap.el (https://github.com/dengste/minimap).
