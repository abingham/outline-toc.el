;;; Commentary:

;; This provides a sidebar buffer which shows a "table of
;; contents" for an associated outline-mode buffer.  Basically,
;; this shows you the sections of the outline-mode buffer, but
;; not the bodies.  This is to help you remember where you are in
;; a large document.

;; Simply use M-x outline-toc-mode to toggle activation of the
;; outline-toc.  Use 'M-x customize-group RET outline-toc RET' to
;; adapt outline-toc to your needs.

;; Much of this was originally adapated from David Engster's
;; excellent minimap.el (https://github.com/dengste/minimap).
